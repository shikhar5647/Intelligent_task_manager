# Task Management System

This project is aimed at creating a comprehensive task management system with various key features and integration with a relational database management system (DBMS).

## Key Features

### 1. Priority Queue for Task Scheduling

- Implement a priority queue to manage tasks based on their priority levels.
- Utilize algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* for dynamically adjusting priorities based on deadlines, dependencies, and user preferences.

### 2. Graph Representation for Task Dependencies

- Model task dependencies using a graph structure.
- Implement a topological sort algorithm to ensure proper task execution order.

### 3. Segment Tree for Time Interval Queries

- Utilize a segment tree to efficiently handle time intervals for tasks with specific start and end times.
- Implement algorithms for querying and updating time intervals.

### 4. Trie for Autocomplete and Tagging

- Implement a trie data structure for efficient autocomplete suggestions and tagging of tasks.
- Use algorithms to search and insert into the trie for quick task identification.

### 5. Red-Black Tree for Balanced Search Operations

- Employ a red-black tree to maintain a balanced search structure for certain operations.
- Utilize the tree for searching tasks based on keywords or specific criteria.

## DBMS Integration

- Utilize a relational database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) to store and manage task-related data.
- Design a schema that accommodates task details, priorities, dependencies, and timestamps.
